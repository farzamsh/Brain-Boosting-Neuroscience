Alarm App
This is a simple alarm application written in Python that allows you to set an alarm with a specified maximum time and the number of times the alarm should ring. It will randomly ring the alarm within the specified time interval and play a sound.

Requirements
Python 3.x
playsound library (can be installed using pip install playsound)
Usage
Run the script using Python: python alarm.py.
Enter the maximum time for the alarm in the format of hours (h) or minutes (m). For example, you can enter 1.5h for 1.5 hours or 90m for 90 minutes.
Enter the number of times the alarm should ring.
The alarm will ring randomly within the specified time interval and play a sound. Each ring will be separated by a random time interval.
After all the rings, the script will display the remaining time until the maximum time is reached.
Note: The sound file (ring.mp3) should be in the same directory as the script.

Example
mathematica
Copy code
Enter the maximum time for the alarm (e.g. 1.5h or 90m): 1.5h
Enter the number of times the alarm should ring: 3
Alarm will ring 3 times in 90.0 minutes.
Ring! Ring! Ring! Alarm 1 rang after 29.237572 seconds.
[Sound plays]
Ring! Ring! Ring! Alarm 2 rang after 16.914764 seconds.
[Sound plays]
Ring! Ring! Ring! Alarm 3 rang after 32.847187 seconds.
[Sound plays]
Alarm finished ringing.
You still have 31.999476 seconds left.
Customization
You can replace the ring.mp3 file with your own preferred sound file. Make sure the file is in the same directory as the script and update the file name in the code accordingly.
